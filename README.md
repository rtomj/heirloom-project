## The Heirloom Project

This is a fork of [The Heirloom Project](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net) CVS repositoriesâ€” a 
collection 
of hisorical UNIX tools,principally derived from System V, which have been patched to build on a modern system.

Particularly noteworthy are its historical Bourne shell, toolchain, and source code management tools. It includes 
some of the original implementations of m4, lex, yacc, SCCS, troff, etc. Also included here are the related 
original [vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net)  and [nail](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html) (mailx) 
repositories.

### Changes:
* After encountering cpio errors and researching the cause, [this page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/SolarisCrossCompiler) 
recommends the following changes:

`fix the call to open on line 1013 of libpkg/pkgtrans.c to open(tmp_file, O_RDWR, O_CREAT)`

`fix the cpio command lines in libpkg/pkgtrans.c lines 1151, 1164, 1595 and 1827 to remove the "-D"`

`fix the call to execl on line 180 of libpkg/runcmd.c to use "/bin/sh"`

`replace the sizeof (unsigned long) on line 328 of libpkg/verify.c to ucp += 4`

* pkgtrans.c and verify.c have been changed but runcmd.c still uses /sbin/sh

* Changed heirloom-devtools/make/bsd/bsd.cc to [not use auto as type specifier](https://www.illumos.org/rb/r/353/diff/1?expand=1#0)

* Changed "include<bsd/bsd.h>" to use the included bsd.h in heirloom-devtools/make/include/bsd for the following files:

  -heirloom-devtools/make/bsd/bsd.cc

  -heirloom-devtools/make/mksh/misc.cc

  -heirloom-devtools/make/src/main.cc

  -heirloom-devtools/make/src/misc.cc
  
* Changed vi/ex_re.c to use heirloom/libcommon/regexp.h
* Added /sbin make install option for sh

### Notes:
* pkgrm has an issue with directories. See heirloom-pkgtools/libpkg/rrmdir.c 
* All components compiled successfully on CRUX 3.4 Linux with gcc 7.4.0 
* Should build on most Linux distributions
* Currently ex-vi, and sh from this repo build on FreeBSD 12 with patches from it's ports collection. There are other patches for 
the toolchest, mailx, and doctools which will probably work but I'm not sure how to include all of these in the repo (include BSD 
license along with the other licenses?)

### Legal:
I in no way claim to have written any of the original software contained in this repo. This software 
derives from original Unix sources released as open source by Caldera and Sun and [The Heirloom 
Project](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net) maintained by Gunnar Ritter.
